    "### Satellite data\n",
    "\n",
    "Satellite data come from either polar or low inclination orbits that circle the Earth or geostationary orbits that hold a location above a specific location on the Earth, near the Equator.  The type of data from satellites depends on both the orbit and the type of instrument.  There are definitions for the different satellite data types.\n",
    "- L1 - satellite observations, usually each observation has a lat/lon/time associated with it\n",
    "- L2 - derived geophysical retrievals (eg. SST), still with lat/lon/time\n",
    "- L3 - variables mapped to a uniform space/time grid\n",
    "- L4 - model output or analysis of data, may include multiple sensors\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several different formats that satellite data:  [netCDF](https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/), [HDF5](https://www.hdfgroup.org/solutions/hdf5/), and [geoTIFF](https://earthdata.nasa.gov/esdis/eso/standards-and-references/geotiff).\n",
    "There are also som newer cloud optimized formats that data: [Zarr](https://zarr.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF ([COG](https://www.cogeo.org/)).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Understand the data\n",
    "Data access can be easy and fast on the cloud, but to avoid potential issues down the road, spend time to understand the strengths and weaknesses of any data.  Any science results will need to address uncertainties in the data, so it is easier to spend time at the beginning to understand them and avoid data mis-application.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### This tutorial will focus on netCDF/HDF5/Zarr\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data proximate computing\n",
    "These are BIG datasets that you can analyze on the cloud without downloading the data.  \n",
    "You can run this on your phone, a Raspberry Pi, laptop, or desktop.   \n",
    "By using public cloud data, your science is reproducible and easily shared!\n",
    "\n",
    "The OHW Jupyter Hub is a m5.2xlarge instance shared by up to 4 users.  What does that mean?  [m5.2xlarge](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/m5/) has 8 vCPU and 32 GB memory.\n",
    "If there are 3 other users on your node, then the memory could be used up fast by large satellite datasets, so just be a little aware of that when you want to run something....\n",
    "\n",
    "### Here we will demonstrate some ways to access two different geostationary SST datasets on AWS:\n",
    "- AWS GOES sea surface temperatures  (L2)\n",
    "- AWS Himawari sea surface temperatures (L2 and L3)\n",
